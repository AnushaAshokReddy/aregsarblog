# About Me

I'm a software developer that helps small development teams rapidly build and deploy robust and maintainable web app features.

In the past I have developed software for organizations as diverse as America Online, Autobytel and Walt Disney.

I use functional programming, object oriented programming and domain driven design principles while coding in PHP, Javascript and C# to build reliable software.

## My current web development stack

+ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) - Containers that run my development environment
+ [Laravel](https://laravel.com) - Rapid web application development framework
+ [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core) - High performance asynchronous web API framework
+ [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/origin) - Controllers for organizing client side javascript
+ [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - Javascript UI widgets embedded in HTML rendered pages
+ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) UI design framework for web developers
+ [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) Secure third party webhook testing

## My lean development process

+ [Endpoint Driven Development](index.md) - feature development guarded by feature tests
+ [Always Deployed](index.md) - continuous delivery guarded by feature flags
+ [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) - continuous integration into master delivery branch
+ [No Estimates](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement/) - because software estimation is not reliable
+ [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits) with WIP limit of one and the [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) technique using [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com) for feature task managemnt
