# About Me

I help development teams rapidly build and deploy robust and maintainable web application features.

In the past I have developed mission critical software for organizations as diverse as America Online, Autobytel and Walt Disney.

I am also the author of the [Always Deployed Manifesto](https://alwaysdeployed.com) and [Endpoint Driven Development](https://alwaysdeployed.com/endpoint-driven-development) web application development and deployment methodologies that help developers provide continuous customer value, faster, by using [tools](https://alwaysdeployed.com/tools) that support this development process.
