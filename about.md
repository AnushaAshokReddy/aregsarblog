# About Me

I'm a software developer that helps small development teams rapidly build and deploy robust and maintainable web application features.

In the past I have developed software for organizations as diverse as America Online, Autobytel and Walt Disney.

I use Functional Programming, Object Oriented Programming, Domain Driven Design and [Vertical Slice Architecture](https://jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) principles while coding in C#, PHP, Python and Javascript to help teams build reliable software, faster and more efficiently.

I am also the author of the [Always Deployed Manifesto](https://alwaysdeployed.com) and [Endpoint Driven Development](https://alwaysdeployed.com/endpoint-driven-development) web application development and deployment methodologies that help developers provide continuous customer value faster, using [tools](https://alwaysdeployed.com/tools) that support this development process.

## My lean development process

+ [Always Deployed](https://alwaysdeployed.com) - continuous delivery guarded by feature flags
+ [Endpoint Driven Development](https://alwaysdeployed.com/endpoint-driven-development) - incremental feature development guarded by feature tests
+ [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) - continuous integration into master delivery branch
+ [No Estimates](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement) - because working software is the primary measure of progress
+ [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) using [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com) for feature task management
