# About Me

Hi, my name is Areg and I help development teams rapidly build and deploy reliable and maintainable web applications.

In the past I have developed mission critical software for organizations as diverse as America Online, Autobytel and Disney.

I am the author of the [Always Deployed Manifesto](https://alwaysdeployed.com) and [Endpoint Driven Development](https://alwaysdeployed.com/endpoint-driven-development) web application development and deployment methodologies that help developers provide continuous customer value, faster, by using [tools](https://alwaysdeployed.com/tools) that support this development process.

## My rapid application development stack

My web development stack is focused on building server side `HTML` rendered [Majestic Monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith) web apps.

## My lean development process

+ [Always Deployed](https://alwaysdeployed.com) - continuous delivery guarded by feature flags
+ [Endpoint Driven Development](https://alwaysdeployed.com/endpoint-driven-development) - incremental feature development guarded by feature tests
+ [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) - continuous integration into master delivery branch
+ [No Estimates](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement) - because working software is the primary measure of progress
