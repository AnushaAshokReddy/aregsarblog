# About Me

I'm a software developer that helps small development teams rapidly build and deploy robust and maintainable web application features.

In the past I have developed software for organizations as diverse as America Online, Autobytel and Walt Disney.

I use functional programming, object oriented programming and domain driven design principles while coding in C#, PHP, Python and Javascript to help teams build reliable software.

## My web development stack

+ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) - Containers that run my development environment
+ [Laravel](https://laravel.com) - Rapid web application development framework
+ [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core) - High performance asynchronous web API framework
+ [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org) - Controllers for organizing client side javascript
+ [Vue](https://vuejs.org) - Javascript UI widgets embedded in HTML rendered pages

## My lean development process

+ [Always Deployed](https://alwaysdeployed.com) - continuous delivery guarded by feature flags
+ [Endpoint Driven Development](https://alwaysdeployed.com/endpoint-driven-development) - incremental feature development guarded by feature tests
+ [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com) - continuous integration into master delivery branch
+ [No Estimates](http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/the-noestimates-movement) - because working software is the primary measure of progress
+ [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) using [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com) for feature task management
