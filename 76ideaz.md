# 76ideaz - Independent ideas from a to z

At 76ideaz its not business as usual.

We are small team of web designers and developers that have many years of experience developing and deploying web applications.

We have put systems in place that allow us to quickly develop reliable and maintainable web applications for our clients.

Unlike other consultancies, our process allows our clients to continuously monitor the progress of their application in a real production environment on a daily basis starting from the first week of the project.

Try us out for a week free, if at the end of the week you do not want to move forward we understand that we may not be a good fit.

Should you decide to continue, you can pay us for the week and we will work the next week for free. Then you can decide again to stop or continue with the same weekly terms.

The last week of the project is always on us.

We charge $10,000 USD per week to do the maximum amount of work possible based on our agile workflow, for our exclusive client for that week.

We work exclusively with one client at a time on a week to week basis so we can give the proper attention our clients need to their concerns.

By the end of the first week you will have a bare bones web application with a home page deployed and running in production to which you can add more and more features on a weekly basis. See our first week free offer page for more details: [76ideaz Offer](https://aregsar.com/76ideazoffer)

Still not sure if you'd like to try us out, then maybe some of the reasons below can make up your mind:

Here is how we are different from other consultancies:

1-We focus on making Simple, Usable and quick to build applications:

At 76ideaz We specialize in simple, clean and usable html rendered web sites that are quick to develop and easy to change and maintain.
We use only the least amount of javascript needed to add interactivity where it makes sense.

We don't build bloated, complicated and slow loading, with tons of loading spinners, javascript heavy web applications.

These types of apps are complex and time consuming to develop, an harder to debug and maintain.

SPAS and Javascript frameworks may be all the rage these days, but the truth is that these technologies actually make web applications much more complex and time consuming to develop. They slow down the time to build and deploy applications by up to ten times in some cases.

Javascript heavy apps are harder to test, introduce a whole new set of possible bugs and errors and in many cases perform worse than simple html rendered apps. And frankly most often they are overkill and not needed for the best user experience.

The types of apps that we build are apps that are designed for the web where the same site can be used for all user devices. All our tooling and workflow is geared to make building of these types of applications very fast.

The types of apps we can develop range from simple marketing and information sites to media content sites, event ticketing sites, ecommerce sites, SAAS, small business and professional services sites, membership and marketplace sites. We can also develop simple and easy to use dashboards, CRMs and CMSs.

If you need highly interactive dash boards or desktop application like functionality then we might not be the right fit for you.

2-We have a transparent process

We use ad and edd principles to get your site up and running quickly, BEFORE we start building features, so you can see results daily and use the site as we continue build it. 
This way we can course correct quickly based on your feedback and you will have the comfort of knowing that your site is actually working as we add more features without last minutes surprises.

3-We use Simple to manage infrastructure

We deploy all our sites to digital ocean because they greatly simplify infrastructure management and allow us to focus on your application features.

-For $20/mo digital ocean offers a managed database service with database backups, failover and server maintanance to give you high availabilty and confidence that your data is safe.

-For $10/mo digita ocean offers a loadbalancer service with free SSL certificates so your application can easily be scaled and secured with requiring us to setup and maintain a load balancer and have to renew SSL certificates. 

-Finally we use tooling that we developed specifically to deploy applications to the digital ocean load balancer.
This allows us to practice blue green deployment which means we can bring up a server with a new version of your app, have it reviewed by you, then instantly swap the new version in for the old version.

4- We provide Obsarvability in Production

When we say a new version of an app is deployed to production, we mean not only that the code is running in production but that you have visibility into how it is performing as well. 
What good is a deployed application if you have no idea if it is running without issues and functioning properly.
So we make sure to build in instrumentation into the code that can report on the health and status and usage of the application.
Specifically we can integrate third party services to catch any application errors and alert stakeholders, or to run reporting queries against application logs and the database.

These are the services we use which have differentt tiers that you can choose. We do not charge for using these services through us and only pass on the costs directly to you.

We check for four specific categories of metrics from most to least critical:
a-is the site up and responding using
pingdom for site uptime monitoring

b-are there any errors happening when running using
sentry for error reporting and alerting

c-how is the application performing in turns of page load times and server resource usage, using
rollbar for application monitoring 

d-what feature are being used and by who, using
rollbar for user statistics

e-capturing a trail of statistics to aid in troubleshooting production issues and for running queries to gain insight into feature usage and for auditing purposes using
papertrail for logging

5-We use a tech stack for worry free maintainability in the future

We use Laravel the most popular and growing rapid application development and deployment php web framework.

Using the laravel framework gives us a few advantages:

-its a batteries included framework so we get development speed to rapidly build and deploy features
-the most popular php framework that means many laravel programmers that can quickly jump in to an existing application to maintain
-a huge community of php and laravel developers support the framework with libararies, plugins, utilities and blog posts.
-it has excellent documentation
-uses the php programming language that has an abundant pool of reasonably priced developers.
-php is one of the easiest to deploy languages

We hope that by this point we have convinced you that working with us to build your web application is not business as usual and that you can have high confidence in the outcome of your project by being involved in the development process starting from day one.

## 76ideaz first week offer

By the end of the first week you will have a bare bones web application with a home page deployed and running in production to which you can add more and more features on a weekly basis.

In addition at the end of the first week your application will be up and running behind a secure load balancer on an application server backed a cache and database server provisioned along with a job queue,background job workers and a periodic task scheduler.

Optionally if needed, we can add a user authentication system with registration, login, email verification and background email delivery integrated with a third party email delivery service.

To top it all off you will have database backups and application monitoring services in place.

In the following week we will give you a public URL to track the progress of your project in the real world, along with dashboard accounts to monitor your applications.

Ofcourse you will get access to the code repository as well, in addition to all third party service account passwords,secrets and keys.
And access to a shared Kanban board where you can comment on features being developed so we can collaborate and incorporate your feedback as we are building out your application.
